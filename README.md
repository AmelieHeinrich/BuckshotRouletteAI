# Buckshot Roulette AI : an AI project that reproduces the gameplay of Buckshot Roulette and implements a fair AI that plays against you.

## The way the AI works

The AI works by evaluating the chances of the next bullet being a live looking at how many lives/blanks are left in the chamber.
It determines the odds in 5 levels: Certain, Likely, Even, Unlikely, Impossible.
Depending on the odd, it will choose an approriate action, or use an item to make the odds more in his favour, just like how a real human would.
The AI also uses advantageous items at the beginning of the turn like a cigarette, handcuffs or magnifying glass if he has one.
